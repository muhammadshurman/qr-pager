/**
 * Which ARRANGEMENT a tenant's published page uses. `QRPAGER-33`, narrowed to three by `QRPAGER-47`.
 *
 * ================================================================================
 * IT ARRANGES; IT DOES NOT RENDER. THAT SPLIT IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM.
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * A block's CONTENT is rendered in exactly one place -- `resources/views/landing/block.blade.php`
 * -- and an arrangement decides order, grouping and emphasis. The retired
 * `packages/ui/src/templates` made the same split for the same reason and wrote it down:
 * *"Three templates each writing their own seven renderings would be twenty-one places a
 * required field could be forgotten, and the test could only check the ones it knew about."*
 *
 * So `TemplateTotalityTest` reads the committed JSON schema and requires every block type to
 * appear in every arrangement's output. A block type added to `BlockSchema` later fails that
 * for each arrangement that does not place it, which is what makes *"no block the tenant
 * placed is absent"* a mechanical fact rather than a habit.
 *
 * ================================================================================
 * ⚠⚠ THREE CASES, AND `classic` / `editorial` ARE RETIRED — `QRPAGER-47`, PART A
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * Muhammad's ticket, in his words: *"Those two were the «بسيط / مميّز» pair the user
 * complained were indistinguishable. rail, ember and tile replace them as the single axis."*
 * So the choice a restaurant makes is now between three arrangements that differ
 * STRUCTURALLY — a ruled column, a dark centred hero, a photo grid — rather than between two
 * that differed by emphasis and read as the same page.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE STORED DOCUMENTS WERE MIGRATED, NOT LEFT TO FAIL VALIDATION.**
 * `2026_11_12_120000_retire_classic_and_editorial` maps `classic → rail` and
 * `editorial → ember` in BOTH `landing_pages.draft_document` and
 * `landing_pages.published_document`, per tenant, keyed, under `§2.10`'s settled pattern. A
 * document that still named a retired case would be refused by `LandingDocument::fromInput()`
 * the next time anything read it — the studio, a republish, the media reference sweep — so
 * the migration is what keeps every tenant's page loadable, and
 * `RetiredTemplateTest` is the test that fails if any document anywhere still names one.
 *
 * ⚠ **AND WHAT RETIRING `classic` COST, NAMED RATHER THAN QUIETLY DROPPED.** `classic` was
 * the arrangement that reproduced `tests/Fixtures/landing/pre-template-page.html` BYTE FOR
 * BYTE, and that fixture was `QRPAGER-33`'s guarantee that *"a tenant who published yesterday
 * and republishes today gets the same page."* Retiring the case retires the guarantee with
 * it: a tenant who was on `classic` now republishes as `rail` and their page CHANGES. That is
 * the ticket's intent — the complaint being answered is that the old pair was
 * indistinguishable — and it is written down here because it is the one thing this change
 * takes away that nothing else gives back.
 *
 * ================================================================================
 * ⚠ NOT A POSTGRES ENUM, AND THAT IS NOT AN EXCEPTION TO `§2.3`
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * `§2.3`'s convention is about a STORED COLUMN: *"the PHP enum is the source; the Postgres
 * type is a native `ENUM` created by migration."* This value is a member of the landing
 * DOCUMENT -- it lives inside `landing_pages.document` jsonb, which is Task 7's contract and
 * is validated by `BlockSchema`/`LandingSchema`, not by a column type. `tenant_language` went
 * the other way on 2026-11-03 (`QRPAGER-30`) precisely because it IS a column.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THAT IS ALSO WHY `QRPAGER-47`'s MIGRATION IS A **DATA** MIGRATION AND NOT A TYPE
 * CHANGE: there is no `ALTER TYPE … DROP VALUE` to write, because there is no type. What
 * exists is rows, which is exactly the case `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md §4 › Postgres traps`
 * says blocks whoever writes the first one.
 *
 * The one-source question still has to be answered, and it is: this enum is the source, and
 * `docs/contracts/landing-page.schema.json`'s `enum` for `template` is GENERATED from
 * `values()` by `php artisan landing:schema-export`, with `bin/landing-schema-check`
 * byte-diffing the committed file against it. The studio's cards are built from `cases()`.
 * There is no second list to keep in step.

     *
     *     app/Domain/Landing/LandingTemplate.php:120  [css-rule-set] carries a CSS rule-set;

/**
 * ================================================================================
 * THE STUDIO, IN A REAL BROWSER — `QRPAGER-41` part B
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * Three of part B's items cannot be settled anywhere else, and one of them was RULED to
 * belong here rather than in the PHP suite.
 *
 * **Item 4, upload on choose.** Muhammad: *"`Livewire::test()->set('upload', …)` makes the
 * temporary file in process and never issues a request. You already know what that cost: a
 * validated upload surface sat behind a globally-refused POST for a whole task with a green
 * suite. **'Uploads when chosen' is a browser case.**"* `§4a` records that defect in full --
 * the guard refused `POST <prefix>/upload-file` with a 404 problem document, a test asserted
 * that 404 as correct, and both were green because what they agreed on was wrong. So this
 * file drives a real `<input type="file">` over a real network.
 *
 * **Item 2, the sticky preview.** Whether an element stays in view while the page scrolls is
 * a question about layout and a scroll position; no server-rendered assertion can reach it.
 *
 * **Item 6, the dark palette.** A resolved colour is a computed style.
 *
 * ================================================================================
 * ⚠ THE STUDIO IS ON THE API ORIGIN, AND THE SESSION REACHES IT BECAUSE OF THE PORT
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * `signInAsStaff()` authenticates through the web origin, which proxies `/v1` to the API
 * (`QRPAGER-24`'s opt-in rewrite), so the session cookie comes back on `TLS_ORIGIN`. The
 * studio is a Filament panel served by the API itself on `TLS_API_ORIGIN`. Those are the
 * SAME HOST on DIFFERENT PORTS, and cookies are not scoped by port (RFC 6265 §8.5), so the
 * session the staff shell established is sent here too.
 *
 * That is a property of the harness rather than of the product, and it is written down
 * because a future change to either origin would break this file in a way whose cause is
 * nowhere near its symptom.
